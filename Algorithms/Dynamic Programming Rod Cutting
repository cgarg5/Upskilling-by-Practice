Dynamic Programming : Rod Cutting Problem
Given a rod of length n inches and an array price[]. price[i] denotes the value of a piece of length i. The task is to determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
Note: price[] is 1-indexed array.
Input: price[] = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]

price=[0,1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
def Bottom_Up(price):
    r=[0]*len(price)    # Remember: use *len(price) to initialize all values to 0 or -1
    s=[-1]*len(price)
    for j in range (1, len(price)): # only run from 1 to len(price)
        q=0
        for i in range(j+1):        # consider all lengths from 1 to j
            if q<price[i]+r[j-i]:     # remember q<price[i]+r[j-i] and not just q<price[i]
                q=price[i]+r[j-i]
                s[j]=i                # remember s[j]=i and not s[i]=i
        r[j]=q
    return r,s
Bottom_Up(price)
